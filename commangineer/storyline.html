                    <p class="para">
                        In 1880, the world seemed to be reaching the end of history. 
                        Peace was flourishing around the world, with businesses, factories, and cities sprawling.

                    <h3>The Auuki</h3>
                    <p class="para">
                        During a mining expedition in Nebraska in 1882, spontanous animals attacks sparked. Observers noticed animals
                        working together, united in hatred against humanity, and a spike in forest growth. President Chester A. Arthur declared
                        a national emergency, and deployed the national guard.

                    <p class="para">
                        President Arthur struggled to rally the nation to fight as this force of nature, 
                        dubbed the "Auuki", seized massive portions of the american interior, culminating in the fall of Chicago, Washington, New York City, and the collapse
                        of the federal government.

                    <p class="para">
                        After America's fall, nations of the world struggled to militarize, and with the failed defenses of Africa and South America, 
                        the Auuki secured dense jungles to attack the rest of the world from. With this strengthened threat, Europe and Asia's days were numbered.

                    <p class="para">
                        As the rest of Earth was falling, the navies of the world moved to secure a small chain of islands in the Atlantic, Salustone.
                        Culminating in a great naval battle and costal defense, Salustone held against the Auuki and took what refugees it could.
