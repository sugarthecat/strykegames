    <h1>Problem</h1>
    <p>
        Assign each node in a graph an arbitrary nonnegative weight. <br />
        Is it always possible to assign each vertex of the graph a nonnegative weight, <br />
        so that the sum of the weights of vertices equals the sum of the weights of edges, <br />
        and each edge's weight is at most the difference bewteen the weights of its endpoints
