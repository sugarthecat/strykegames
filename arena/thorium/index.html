    <h1>Thorium-Man: The Fight for the Periodic Table</h1>
    <div id="game"></div>
    <h2>Abilities</h2>
    Thorium-Man is able to shoot laser beams using his laser cannon (Space), representing Thorium's radioactivity.<br/>
    Thorium-Man is, ironically, not a man and rather a robot. This is representing Thorium's effecient conversion to electricity via nuclear energy.<br/>
    Thorium-Man has an energy shield. This represents how Thorium-Man is heat-resistant, as the regeneration of the energy shield is alike to cooling off.<br/>
    Thorium-Man has overstayed his welcome on Earth, and lived past his half-life, but is fully alive, after defeating Death. <br/>
